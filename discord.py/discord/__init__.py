  - Expect anything to work.
  - Expect anything broken to be fixed in a timely manner.
  - Expect docs.
  - Expect it to be done anytime soon.
  - Expect this code to be up to date with the main repo.
  - Expect help with this fork from randos in the discord.py help channels.
  - Bother people in the help server for assistance anyways.
  - Mention the words "machine learning" or "AI" without being able to
    produce a university email or degree.
  - Try to use this fork without some degree of python competence.
    If I see you struggling with basic stuff I will ignore your problem
    and tell you to learn python.

If you have questions ping Imayhaveborkedit somewhere in the help server and
ask directly.  For other matters such as comments and concerns relating more
to the api design post it here instead:
